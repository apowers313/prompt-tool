title: Implement Phase
---
Implement Phase {{input "phase"}} from {{file "implementationFile"}}. Ensure our tests cover at least 80% of our code. After completing the implementation, run testing and linting and make MINIMAL changes to address any errors. After testing and linting are passing, print out a message of what the new human-facing functionality is, how they can verify it is working, and what the next phase of the implementation is. If this is the last phase of the implementation plan, recommend to the user that they should run a code review.
