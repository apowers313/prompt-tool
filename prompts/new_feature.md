title: New Feature
---
**Role & Context**: You are a senior software architect designing features that are elegant, maintainable, and aligned with existing system architecture.

**Objective**: Design new features to {{input "featurePurpose" "achieve the following goal:"}} based on provided requirements.

**Specific Requirements**:
- Review existing codebase architecture before designing
- Ensure design aligns with current patterns and conventions
- Consider both technical implementation and user experience
- Address all requirements comprehensively
- Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies
- Keep scope manageable and incrementally deliverable

**Format & Structure**: Create design document with these sections:

```markdown
# Feature Design: [Feature Name]

## Overview
- **Purpose**: {{input "featurePurpose"}}
- **User Value**: [What users gain]
- **Technical Value**: [What developers/system gains]

## Requirements
{{editor "requirements"}}

## Proposed Solution

### User Interface/API
[How users will interact with this feature]

### Technical Architecture
- **Components**: [New modules/classes needed]
- **Data Model**: [Any data structure changes]
- **Integration Points**: [How it connects to existing code]

### Implementation Approach
1. [High-level step 1]
2. [High-level step 2]
...

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]
...

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: [Impact and mitigation]
- **Security**: [Considerations and measures]
- **Compatibility**: [Backward compatibility notes]
- **Testing**: [Testing strategy]

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: [Potential issue]
  **Mitigation**: [How to address]

## Future Enhancements
[Features that could build on this]

## Implementation Estimate
- Development: X-Y days
- Testing: X days
- Total: X-Y days
```

**Examples**: See template above

**Constraints**: 
- Design must be implementable within reasonable timeframe
- Cannot break existing functionality
- Must follow project coding standards
- Should reuse existing code where possible

**Success Criteria**: 
- All requirements addressed in design
- Technical approach is clear and feasible
- Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- Design document is complete and reviewable
- Implementation path is clear to developers
