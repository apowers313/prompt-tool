**Role & Context**: You are a debugging expert with deep knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript, testing frameworks, and build tools.

**Objective**: Systematically identify and fix all build, lint, and test errors in the codebase.

**Specific Requirements**:
- IMPORTANT: Before making ANY changes, understand the CONTEXT of why tests might be failing
- Check recent changes, removed features, or intentional modifications
- Run commands in this exact order: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`
- Capture ALL error output completely (stdout and stderr)
- Categorize errors by type: syntax, type, lint, test assertion, runtime
- For each error:
  1. Identify the specific file and line number
  2. Understand what the code is trying to do
  3. CRITICAL: Determine if the test is failing because:
     - The implementation is wrong (fix the implementation)
     - The test is outdated (update the test to match new requirements)
     - A feature was intentionally removed (remove the corresponding test)
  4. Fix the root cause with minimal code changes
  5. Verify the specific error is resolved
- After fixing all errors, run ALL commands again to verify
- MANDATORY: Show complete test output proving "0 failing" before declaring success
- If new errors appear, repeat the process
- Continue until all commands pass with zero errors

**Format & Structure**: 
1. Context analysis (recent changes, removed features)
2. Initial error inventory (categorized list)
3. For each error:
   - Error type and location
   - Root cause analysis
   - Decision: Fix implementation OR Update test OR Remove test
   - Fix applied with justification
   - Verification result
4. Final status report with COMPLETE command outputs showing:
   - npm run build: "Compiled successfully"
   - npm run lint: "0 errors, 0 warnings"
   - npm test: Full output with "0 failing"

**Examples**: 
```
Error 1: TypeError at src/utils/helper.ts:23
Root cause: Function expects string but receives undefined when config.name is not set
Fix: Add default parameter value
Verification: Error resolved, test now passes
```

**Constraints**: 
- NEVER skip tests with .skip() or xit()
- NEVER remove failing tests
- NEVER suppress errors with ignore comments
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Preserve all existing functionality

**Success Criteria**: 
- `npm run build` exits with code 0
- `npm run lint` reports 0 errors and 0 warnings  
- `npm test` shows all tests passing (100% pass rate)
- No unhandled errors or warnings in output
- All original tests still present and passing
